                <p>
                    Welcome to my page! My name is <strong>Kevin Ponting</strong> and I am part Venezuelan
                    Filipino, and Japanese. Currently I am a third year computer science student at a
                    university.I transferred from a community college and I realized that a university
                    campus is so much larger and nicer in comparison to a community college one. I look
                    forward continuing my education and furthering my knowledge in this field!

                <p>
                    Above are a list of my many hobbies! I have only been playing basketball since
                    middle school, but it is defintely my favorite hobby out of the list. Honestly, I
                    only picked up lifting as a hobby because I wanted to be stronger for basketball.
                    On the other hand, video games have always been apart of my life ever since I was
                    a kid. I used to only play multiplayer games such as Call of Duty and NBA 2K but
                    recently I've only been playing single player games. As for my favorite games,
                    Terraria and Omori are my top two. Next, I love listening to music. Music helps
                    me focus and makes anything I'm doing fun. My favorite genres are K-Pop, J-Pop,
                    and rap. Lastly, I've been learning Japanese for about a year now and I've been
                    really enjoying it. My end goal is to be fluent and hopefully visit Japan one day!
