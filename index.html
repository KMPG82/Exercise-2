                    Welcome to my page! My name is <strong>Kevin Ponting</strong> and I am part Venezuelan<br>
                    Filipino, and Japanese. Currently I am a third year computer science student at a university.<br>
                    I transferred from a community college and I realized that a university campus is so much<br>
                    larger and nicer in comparison to a community college one. I look forward continuing my<br>
                    education and furthering my knowledge in this field!

                <p>
                    Above are a list of my many hobbies! I have only been playing basketball since<br>
                    middle school, but it has positively affected my life in many ways. Honestly, I<br>
                    only picked up lifting as a hobby because I wanted to be stronger for basketball.<br>
                    On the other hand, video games have always been apart of my life ever since I was<br>
                    a kid. I used to only play multiplayer games such as Call of Duty and NBA 2K but<br>
                    recently I've only been playing single player games. As for my favorite games,<br>
                    Terraria and Omori are my top two. Next, I love listening to music. Music helps<br>
                    me focus and makes anything I'm doing fun. My favorite genres are K-Pop, J-Pop,<br>
                    and rap. Lastly, I've been learning Japanese for about a year now and I've been<br>
                    really enjoying it. My end goal is to be fluent and hopefully visit Japan one day!<br>
