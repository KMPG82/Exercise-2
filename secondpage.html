                <p>
                    Basketball has been a crucial part of my life and is my favorite hobby.
                    So, I think it deserves a dedicated section! Personally, I think it is
                    the best sport in the world and provides a fun way of staying active.
                    I've been told by friends and family that I play like Paul George. However,
                    not only do I like playing basketball, but I also like watching it. I try
                    to watch every game of my two favorite teams, the Miami Heat and the Los
                    Angeles Lakers. When it comes to my favorite players, I have way too many
                    as each of them have a unique skillset and playstyle, but Kobe Bryant is
                    the player that got me interested in basketball. I hope to keep playing
                    basketball for as long as my body can handle it, but even when the time
                    comes when I have to put down the ball for good, at least I'll be able to
                    watch NBA games!
